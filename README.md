## $ whoami?

I am Sinan, a software engineer based in Istanbul.

I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, writing the tool that'll solve the problem is my thing. I feel comfortable working with C/C++, C#/F#, Java & Python. I have worked in fields like Android development, linux development, robotics with Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson, machine learning and web development until now, and still trying to learn and improve my knowledge to be a valuable asset to humanity.
