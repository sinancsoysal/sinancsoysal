## $ whoami?

I am Sinan, a software engineer based in Istanbul.

I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, writing the tool that'll solve the problem is my thing. I feel comfortable working with C/C++, Java & Python. I'm studying DevOps for OT in my spare time and currently working on a UAV project.
